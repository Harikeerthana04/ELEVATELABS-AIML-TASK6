# Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

## Overview
This task involves implementing KNN on the Iris dataset to classify flower species based on petal and sepal measurements.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Steps
1. Loaded and visualized the Iris dataset.
2. Normalized features using `StandardScaler`.
3. Trained a KNN model using various K values.
4. Evaluated model with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
5. Plotted error rate vs K to choose the best K.

## Key Learnings
- Instance-based learning
- Importance of normalization in distance-based algorithms
- Trade-offs when choosing K

## Results
Best accuracy observed with K = 5.
